"""tax_value 12 -> 6 for HOB (ADR 0015)

Revision ID: c8f2a1b60d33
Revises: b1c7d4e9a20f
Create Date: 2026-09-22

The commitment tax is now summed per off-color rather than read off a pair
gap, so `tax_value` prices one whole off-color rather than a pair-overlap
fraction. The seeding migration is left untouched; this records the change
as its own step, which is also how ADR 0013 s4 says the value should move --
by hand, never by a job.
