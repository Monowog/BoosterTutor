"""Format-level constants for the fitness function (ADR 0013).

Some of what the fitness function needs varies by format rather than being a
universal truth: how far the average win rate sits, how many picks a pack
yields, what a winning deck's curve looks like, and how hard that format
punishes three-colour soup. Those used to be scattered across module
constants in two files and a dataclass of otherwise-global weights, with
only a comment to say which was which.

**Nothing writes to this table automatically.** Scripts print, a person
transcribes. The values change roughly once per set, so automating a
three-times-a-year edit buys nothing and risks a nightly job quietly
clobbering a hand-picked number. The `source` column records how each row's
values were arrived at.

    """One row per draftable format: a set plus a 17Lands event type.

    Keyed by both because Premier and Traditional Draft are different
    formats with different match structures, and `card_archetype_stats` and
    `archetype_stats` will be keyed the same way -- anything else invites a
    silent mismatch where the constants come from one event type and the
    card statistics from another.

    Percentage-point values are `Numeric`, not `Float`: these are
    hand-authored decimal constants where binary drift would be silent and
    confusing to anyone reading the table. Callers convert with `float()` at
    the boundary, since the fitness function is float throughout.

    Deliberately no foreign key to `sets`: a row here can be written before
    the set has been ingested, and the seeded HOB row below would otherwise
    depend on ingest order.
